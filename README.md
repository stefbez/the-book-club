# The Book Club

## Milestone Project 3

This project is not currently hosted, a new link will be up soon

As part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Diploma I have created this website using the technologies learnt throughout the course so far.

This website shows off Python, Flask, Jinja, MongoDB & Materialize knowledge recently learnt along with JQuery, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS previously learnt. These skills are used to make a Book review/sharing site that allows users to view recommended books from other users, and allows them to buy the books. Users can also upload their own books and reviews in the hopes that they will inspire another user to read and enjoy that book.

## UX

The UX process was vital in creating an appealing site that avid book readers and reviewers would want to visit and use. With a consistent colour scheme throughout, and easy to use features and buttons, this website allows users of any age and technical ability to share books and read reviews.

I used trello to create user stories that are relevant to what each type of user expects and wants from this site. The aim of this site is to create a community of avid book readers who want to share books and recommendations with each other.

### User stories

Writing user stories was an important step in understanding how my website should look and work. Thinking about it from the user's perspective gave me the opportunity to create something that everyone will enjoy and gives the user what they expect.

* As a user I want to see the sites name upon entering
* As a user I want to find books easily on the main page
* As a user I want to see each book's cover photo to find it easily, as if in a library
* As a user and book reader I want to be able to purchase the book recommended with a direct link
* As a user and bookworm I want to see user reviews before choosing which book i want to read next
* As a user who knows what I'm looking for, I want a search function for book title, author name or genre
* As a user and book reader I want to recommend books to others by adding them to the website
* As a user I want to be able to register and login whenever I visit to use all website features
* As a user i want to be able to edit my details after registering
* As a user i want to edit book details that i've submitted after submission
* As a user i want to delete books that i've posted if I don't want it to appear anymore
* As a user I want to be able to delete my profile if I no longer want to use the site
* As an admin user I want to have full access to edit all posts by all users
* As an admin I want to be able to add new genres and delete them in the database from the website
* As an admin user I want to be able to edit users details and delete their profile if needed

### Mockups

Mockups, created on Balsamiq, were the first stage of planning the website can be found [here](/mockups/the-book-club-mockups.pdf)

I created a copy of the database structure that can be viewed [here](/mockups/database-structure.png)

The styling has changed slightly from the mockups, featuring a larger search bar on the library page to encourage users to search for favourite authors or genres or to find a review for a book theyve considered reading. Across the site a few buttons have changed or been positioned differently to shown to enhance UX.

## Technologies Used

* [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) - Using flask, the python language was used for backend production of the website and allowed many frontend functions to be displayed.
* [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)) - The web framework written in python was used for all backend functions.
* [Jinja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)) - The templating language used in the HTML docs to easily show the data on the frontend.
* [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB) - The database used to hold the book, user and genre data. It can be written to by the users and admin. The data is read by python functions. The data can be updated and deleted by users and admin. 
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) - The framework that provides basic styling, and interactive items such as the modals. I built upon the basic styling to create a more unique site. Useful for creating a dynamic site that works on all screen sizes.
* [Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/) - Used to hash the passwords, to keep logging in and users passwords secure.
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JQuery library was used to initialise all of the interactive materialize functions.
* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - HTML is used to make up the base of each web page. I created elements that used jinja templating inside to create a more dynamic site
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - Styling for the whole site, from backgrounds to text fonts, sizes and colors.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) - Used to display icons on the buttons for a good visual aid.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Chose the fonts carefully from Google Fonts and embedded them to the CSS page and used them throughout the site.

## Testing

Testing was carried out on desktop and mobile during the building of each function for the site, making use of the debugger to find any faults in the code quickly.
I work on a mac using OS X and built the site on gitpod using Chrome. When I deployed the final version of the website it worked exactly as expected.
I tested throughout using iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy A40 and MacBook Pro. 

One issue I dealt with and was vital for correct functionality of the website came on the edit profile and admin edit profile pages. The python function used originally had the password updating each time anything was updated, resulting in the hashed password value becoming the actual password. This was remidied by updating the function to update individually. This issue was only discovered through thorough testing.
Tested the HTML pages, CSS, Python & Javascript on the [HTML validator website](https://validator.w3.org/), [CSS validator website](http://www.css-validator.org/), [Python validator website](http://pep8online.com) & [a Javascript validator website](https://jshint.com/).

#### HTML errors:

* Warnings and errors are all centered around the lack of "doctype" and the use of the Jinja template throughout. The html files inherit the DOCTYPE and head tags including links to required sources (JS, CSS and CDNs) from the base.html page. These errors are acceptable as the validator does not recognise Jinja templating.

#### CSS errors:

* No errors found

#### Python errors:

* No errors found

#### JS errors:

* No errors found

### Testing across multiple devices and browsers on completion

Developed on a MacBook Pro using GitPod and checked throughout development on Chrome
Tested on the following devices:

* MacBook Pro 13" - Internet Explorer (using Safari developer tools), Safari, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera

### Bugs
#### Issues found on devices and browsers

Very few issues found across all devices, browsers and screen sizes. All looked as expected and intended.

Issues:

* Internet explorer displayed the horizontal rule under the header text slightly differently to what was expected, but it still looks good.

* The "X" at the top right of the library modal would sometimes not display on iPhone X safari. Close and open modal and it would display.

## Deployment

I used GitPod to develop the site and Heroku linked to a GitHub repo to host it.

The website can be found on the link at the top of the page and here - [The Book Club](http://sb-the-book-club.herokuapp.com/). I deployed the project using Heroku. At the moment the deployed version uses the master branch, but if future updates are needed these can be done using a separate branch until all updates are tested thoroughly and can be deployed.

### Deployment using Heroku

1. Create a Github repository and open this in Gitpod or your choice of IDE
1. Go to the Heroku Dashboard and create a new app
2. In the settings tab of the app click Reveal Config Vars and enter the values for these keys: 
    * IP
    * MONGO_DBNAME
    * MONGO_URI
    * PORT
    * SECRET_KEY
3. In Gitpod create a .gitignore file
4. Create an env.py file containing all of the variables above and add it to the .gitignore
5. Create a requirements.txt by using the command "pip freeze --local > requirements.txt", in order for Heroku to know which dependancies are required to run the app
6. Create a Procfile by using the command "echo web: python app.py > Procfile"
7. Go to the Deploy tab on Heroku and navigate to the 'Deployment method' section
8. Select 'Connect to GitHub'
9. Make sure your GitHub profile is displayed and enter the repo name from step 1
10. Select search and once it loads click connect to connect to the app
11. Enable automatic deployment clicking the button below
12. Select the branch you want to deploy from in the 'Manual Deploy' section, mine is just the master branch, and select 'Deploy Branch'
13. Wait for a message saying 'Your app was successfully deployed". You can now select the 'View' button to see your deployed site
14. Once the steps above are completed whenever you push to GitHub, Heroku will automatically update

### Clone The Book Club

1. Go to the [repository](https://github.com/stefbez/the-book-club)
2. Click on the green `Code` button that features a download icon
3. Copy the URL - (https://github.com/stefbez/the-book-club.git)
4. Using the terminal in GitPod paste the code `git clone https://github.com/stefbez/the-book-club.git`
5. The whole repository folder, including all files are now available for use
6. The user will be expected to create their own env.py file
